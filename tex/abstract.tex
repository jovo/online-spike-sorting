% \smug: Online Real-time Gamma-process Autoregressive Spike-sorting Model

As technology development enables simultaneously measuring from ever larger populations of neurons, we are faced with a complementary problem of discovering meaning from brain activity.  As a first step, we must separate neural signals from background noise.  In electrophysiology experiments, classically, this proceeds in a two-step process: (i) threshold the waveforms to \emph{detect} putative spikes and (ii) \emph{cluster} the waveforms into single units (neurons).  We extend previous Bayesian nonparametric models of neural spiking to \emph{jointly} detect and cluster neurons using a Gamma process model.  Importantly, our online variational Bayesian inference scheme enables real-time inference with performance exceeding the previous state-of-the-art. Via exploratory data analysis---using data with partial ground truth as well as two novel data sets---we find several features of our model collectively contribute to our improved performance including: (i)colored noise, (ii) detecting overlapping spikes, (iii) tracking waveform dynamics, and (iv) using multiple channels.  
We hope to enable novel experiments simultaneously measuring many thousands of neurons and possibly adapting stimuli dynamically to probe ever deeper into the mysteries of the brain.
