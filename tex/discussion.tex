embarrassingly parallel per 4

ignore time steps that aren't useful

let $\lambda_i$ vary as a function of: (i) spike histories, (ii) stimulus, (iii) possibly baseline drift?

{\color{red} perhaps add comments about time-evolution and the false positives we avoid by using multi-channel analysis}

\jovo{add grids to all panels of all figs by default, remove if it looks shitty.}

\jovo{@dec - for fig 1 keep colors/symbols the same in the two panel, if possible.  maybe use a scheme where color indicates algorithm and shape indicates \# of components.  also, be consistent about "IC" cluster vs. "Intracellular" Cluster. and normalize, renaming axes XY Rate instead of only XY. (b) title should be ``ROC Curve Comparisons''}
